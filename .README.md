Ideally, the best possible solution would be to bundle a configuration with the build. However,
for many, this is not practical.

The react-static-config-loader component, utilizes ReactJS Context, and injects a value ( a
configuration ) into React Classes. Unfortunately ( as of React 16 ) is incapable of inject it into
JSX functions ( which make sense as JSX are intended to be "Pure" ). This component does provide
prebuilt object that can overcome this by creating HOC's and injecting the context values into the
props.

## Deployment Steps

These are notes for deploying to NPM. I used `npmrc` to manage my NPM identities
(`npm i npmrc -g` to install ). Then I created a new profile called `public` with
(`npmrc -c public`) and then switch to it with `npmrc public`.

* create a pull request from `dev` to `main`
* check out `main`
* `npm version patch -m "message here" or minor`
* `npm publish --access public`
* Then switch to `dev` branch
* And then merge `main` into `dev` and push `dev` to origin
